  header: Why OMS?
  section: about
  text: >-
    OMS has a casual, but professional, working environment. We focus on
    personal and professional development, quality in each part of our
    deliveries and continuous product development and innovation.


    We value our open and including dynamic that gives everyone the opportunity
    to affect their day to day tasks as well as strategic decisions for the
    company. We are a random bunch of people, white-collars, hoodies, skaters,
    metal heads, hip hoppers, Swedes, bicycle nerds and even a Dutch guy. If you
    are familiar with table tennis or foosball this is an advantage, but not
    necessary.
