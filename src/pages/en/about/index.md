  text: >-
    The company has its origins from InfoStream, which in 1997 developed the
    first version of Manamind Collect. Manamind AS was founded in 2001, with
    Collect as a cornerstone. Today a new version of Collect is still the
    foundation of our deliveries and is what allows us to collect vast amounts
    of real-time data and distribute it efficiently to our custom-made web
    solutions. With domain knowledge in the field of market data and finance, we
    work hard to provide solutions with high quality, availability, flexibility
    and great design.
